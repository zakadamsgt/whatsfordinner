Mr Rat is an old soul, hailing from the Bronx.  His father was a circus performer, and carried his son on the road with him as a child.  During this time, Mr. Rat became a street wise performer, capable of swindling innocent circus goers out of their money with card tricks and slight of hand magic.  His father was a gambler and ran afoul with some local gangsters regarding paying back debts that no honest man could make.  When Mr Rat found his father, the gansters had killed him.  This proved to be a turning point for the young Mr. Rat.

It was a couple of years after this event that Mr. Rat, now a batte-hardened roughneck, met the young and intrepid Anna.  The two decided to team up, Mr. Rat handling the arms trafficking and Anna doing all the negotiating and talking.  Over time, Mr Rat became one of the most feared arms dealers in the black market.  With his distinguished attire - his white fur coat, always clean white pressed shirt, and his penchant for diamond cuff links and fine jewelry.  

10 years after his father’s death he tracked down the gangsters.  The mob boss, Don Carlioni, who carried a ruby studded cane and teak-wood carved pipe, was waiting for him.  But to Don’s surprise, the voluptuous Anna presented herself.  While Anna was swooning with Boss Carlioni, Mr. Rat slipped in through the back door and cut his throat.  Mr. Rat now carries the cane and pipe as a sign to all challengers what they may expect.  

Today, his name proceeds him wherever he goes.  In addition to his jewels and accoutrements that he collected from his victims over the years, he now has a necklace made of ammo cartridges - each bullet representing a war lord that he has killed.  Mr Rat will forever have his enemies shaking in their boots and showing the whites of their own eyes.
